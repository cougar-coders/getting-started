# getting-started

Welcome Cougar Coders! For now, watch this document for links about learning coding and organizing how we collaborate on here. 

You can get started learning to code in Python, Java, Ruby, and some others at:

*http://www.codecademy.com/*

>(For now, I recommend starting with Python, but I am looking for good resources to teach more fundamental langauges like "C")

And get some background on computer science by signing up for EdX classes from Harvard (for free) here...
